## Dvorak support for Dyalog APL/Win
If you are user of the Dyalog APL for Windows and would like to use US Dvorak keyboard layout, these files are in help. It is a Dyalog Unicode IME mapping for the Dvorak layout. Here are 2 files, one for US/Dvorak with default APL characters mapping(no redefines for APL keys), another for US/Dvorak mnemonic APL characters location. I've made it taking into consideration my keyboard (Kinesis Advantage), so probably few tweeks will be needed for ordinary keyboards (like location of the / or |), but otherwise it should work for other Dvorak users.

### Usage
- Save these files to "C:\Program Files\Dyalog\UnicodeIME\aplkeys\".
- Start Dyalog
- Go to Options->Configure->Unicode input->Configure Layoutâ€¦ and select a proper file.
